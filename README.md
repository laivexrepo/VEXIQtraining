VEX IQ Training files - RobotC graphical

The repository contains a number fo sample files used for teachign bot TeleOp (operator  driven) and Autonomous robots on the VEX IQ platform.  These examples are build in the RobotC Graphical, but are not to difficult to translate into straight RobotC C programs.

This is a PUBLIC readonly repository, schools wanting to use these exampels should fork the repository to their own github accoutn and subsequently add/modify the code as needed.

All sample programs come as is - and while tested, are not guarunted to be bug free.
